# mt-snowfall
A vertically ascending platformer inspired by pre-smb1 nes/arcade games.


i wasn't planning on releasing the source code until the game was finished but i haven't updated it in months and don't really feel  any drive to nor do i think the gameplay is too interesting, so i'm gonna leave the source code up here. here's the trello board for what i had left https://trello.com/b/E3kRHd4k/unnamed-fox-climbing-game
